[What's New in Python 3.13 – Real Python](https://realpython.com/courses/new-features-python-313/)

[Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) was published on [October 7, 2024](https://peps.python.org/pep-0719/). This new version is a major step forward for the language, although several of the biggest changes are happening under the hood and won’t be immediately visible to you.

In a sense, Python 3.13 is laying the groundwork for some future improvements, especially to the language’s performance. As you watch the course, you’ll learn more about the background for this and dive into some new features that are fully available now.

**In this video course, you’ll learn about some of the improvements in the new version, including:**

- Improvements made to the **interactive interpreter (REPL)**
- **Clearer error messages** that can help you fix common mistakes
- Advancements done in **removing the global interpreter lock (GIL)** and making Python free-threaded
- The implementation of an **experimental Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**
- A host of minor upgrades to **Python’s static type system**

In this video course, you’ll explore these changes and see how this new version of Python can work for you.
